        Hello! I am currently learning many new programming languages here at
        the UCF Bootcamp. I live in Orlando Florida and grew up right near UCF
        campus in Oviedo. I enjoy the outdoors, hiking, gardening, and bee
        keeping, but I also enjoy tech related entertainment. My girlfriend and
        I just recently moved in together and she is a big supporter of my goal
        of wanting to learn computer coding and dive into software engineering.
        I am hoping to get away from the labor intensive jobs and transition
        into a career.
